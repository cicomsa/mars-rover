**Mars rover game solution**

*Steps to solution*

1. Decide on grid shape

2. Given an initial rover position as input:
   * set rover x position on the grid
   * set rover y position on the grid
   * set rover direction on the grid

3. Given a movement request:
   * if 'L' or 'R', change rover direction
   * if 'M', move rover

4. Given an initial rover position and one movement request as input:
   * set a new rover position on the grid

5. Given an initial rover position and a set of movements as input:
   * set a new rover position on the grid
